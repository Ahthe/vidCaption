1
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:9,120
 Is there another option? Let's think about this!

2
00:00:9,120 --> 00:00:13,600
 No, it's the only choice. If I turn out to be wrong, I'll go and rescue him.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,600
 In that case, why don't the three of us run off somewhere together?

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,160
 We can't. They'd use their damn scouts and be able to track us down in no time.

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
 Bardock? Why are you going through so much trouble?

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
 It's not like a sane man to worry about his children. So what's gotten into you?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,840
 I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm constantly fighting, destroying,

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,760
 and I'd actually like to save something from once. Especially someone who is judged to be a

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
 lower-class warrior, like my Kakarot.

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,200
 I've programmed this to head to a distant planet called Earth. The people in that world have low

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:2,720
 power levels and aren't technologically advanced. I think you'll be able to do well there, Gene.

12
00:01:3,440 --> 00:01:7,840
 Good thing is, it's not an extremely valuable world, so I'm hoping it won't even show up on

13
00:01:7,840 --> 00:01:14,000
 the Frieza Force's radar. If your father is wrong about this, then we'll come and get you immediately.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,960
 Listen, son. You do what it takes to survive, got it?

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,880
 We'll see you really soon!

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,360
 Goodbye.

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
 Don't forget us, Kakarot!
